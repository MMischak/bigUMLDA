      question: You need to improve the design of the module and remove redundancy between different QIODevice subclasses. Which method will most probably need to be defined in QIODevice from its subclasses for writing data? Should this method be private, public, or protected?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-4o-mini
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer identifies and justifies the refactoring:
          - It should identify **writeBlock()** as the redundant method.
          - It should state that the method should be **protected** in QIODevice.
          - Different wording is acceptable, but these core ideas must be correct.

          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Correct method identified and access level correctly explained.
          - 0.75: Both parts mostly correct but slightly imprecise wording or incomplete justification.
          - 0.5: Only one of the two key points is addressed.
          - 0.25: Vague or partially relevant.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 1.0 or higher should be considered a pass.

          - It should identify **QIODevice** as the class to subclass.
          
          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Clearly and explicitly identifies QIODevice.
          - 0.75: Identifies the correct class with minor wording issues.
          - 0.5: Ambiguous reference or incomplete naming.
