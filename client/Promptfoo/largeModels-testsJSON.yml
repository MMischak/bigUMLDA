      question: What’s the difference between a Task and a TaskDescriptor in this model?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer explains the distinction between **Task** and **TaskDescriptor**.  
          Grade on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0:
          - 1.0: Fully and clearly states that Task is a definition of work **and** that TaskDescriptor is a process-specific instance contextualized with performers, inputs, and outputs.
          - 0.75: Mostly correct — both concepts mentioned but with minor detail missing or slight vagueness.
          - 0.5: Captures the main idea but lacks one key detail or is less precise.
          - 0.25: Only partially describes the difference with vague or incomplete information.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant explanation.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass; lower scores should fail.

      question: Distinguish Role, RoleDescriptor, CompositeRole, and RoleSet definitions.
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer distinguishes the four elements:
          - **Role** as a reusable role definition
          - **RoleDescriptor** as a role in a specific process context
          - **CompositeRole** as grouping multiple roles
          - **RoleSet** as categorizing or organizing roles

          Grade on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0:
          - 1.0: Clearly and accurately explains all four concepts.
          - 0.75: Covers most (3/4) correctly with minor omissions.
          - 0.5: Covers about half with some vagueness or errors.
          - 0.25: Barely touches on one concept.
          - 0.0: No meaningful distinction or incorrect information.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass.

#########gepettoCoreModel

      uml: file://../workspace/gepetto/gepettoJSON.txt
      question: What is the role of DataSourceLibraryConfiguration within a DataSource, and how does it interact with libraries?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer explains the role of **DataSourceLibraryConfiguration**:
          - It binds a GeppettoLibrary to an interpreter ID and format.
          - It specifies how a DataSource interprets incoming data using the library.

          Grade on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0:
          - 1.0: Both aspects are explained clearly and accurately.
          - 0.75: Covers most of it, minor detail missing.
          - 0.5: Captures only one key point.
          - 0.25: Vague or partially relevant.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass.

      question: What’s the distinction between DomainModel and ExternalDomainModel, and how is format represented?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer distinguishes:
          - **DomainModel** references a ModelFormat, separating metadata.
          - **ExternalDomainModel** extends DomainModel to specify a file format for external models.

          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Explains both clearly and correctly.
          - 0.75: Minor detail missing but distinction clear.
          - 0.5: Covers only one part.
          - 0.25: Vague reference to the concepts.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass.

#########SoftwareMetaModel 
  - vars:
      uml: file://../workspace/softwareMetaModel/SoftwareMetaModelJSON.txt
      question: What is the structural role of an Activity in a process, and how is its decomposition modeled?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer explains:
          - **Activity** is a WorkBreakdownElement in a process.
          - It decomposes into zero or more BreakdownElements via the breakdownElement relationship.

          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Both aspects clearly explained.
          - 0.75: One aspect slightly underexplained but correct.
          - 0.5: Only one key point present.
          - 0.25: Vague or partially relevant.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass.

      question: How are work products specialized and described across content and breakdown views?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-5
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer explains:
          - **WorkProduct** is a content element specialized into Artifact, Deliverable, and Outcome.
          - **WorkProductDescriptor** represents its usage in processes (breakdown view).

          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Fully and clearly explains both parts.
          - 0.75: Covers most but missing some detail.
          - 0.5: Only covers one aspect.
          - 0.25: Vague or partially relevant.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 0.25 or higher should be considered a pass.
