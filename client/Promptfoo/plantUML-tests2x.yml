      question: You need to improve the design of the module shown in the following diagram and remove some redundancy. Which method will most probably need to be defined in QIODevice from it’s subclasses? (Note that the method can still be reimplemented in QIODevice subclasses as needed.) Should this field be private, public or protected?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        provider: openai:gpt-4o-mini
        value: |
          Evaluate how well the answer identifies and justifies the refactoring:
          - It should identify **readData()** as the redundant method.
          - It should state that the method should be defined as **protected** in QIODevice.
          - Different wording is acceptable, but these core ideas must be correct.

          Grading scale:
          - 1.0: Correct method identified and access level correctly explained.
          - 0.75: Both parts mostly correct but slightly imprecise wording or incomplete justification.
          - 0.5: Only one of the two key points is addressed.
          - 0.25: Vague or partially relevant.
          - 0.0: Incorrect or irrelevant.

          A score of 1.0 or higher should be considered a pass.
